### Overview
* Intro
* Figma
* Images

**Intro**
During the making of the project, I was able to used the properties, tags and etc - I've learned from the previous projects such as importing files using @import, @media if you want to have a responsive page.
Assigning width using "calc" to assigned value. It was fun and confusing at the same time. It was also quite difficult than the previous one. I am happy that I am able to work and learn alot in this project. 

This is a project about traveling across the US. We've made it so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**
Regarding with the figma, at first - I was really confuse where to start. I just keep on looking at the details written on the figma. But at time goes by, 
Figma is very useful tools. It shows all the important information you need to build the projects.The margins, font size, width, height and everything that you need visually for the project.
It was fun to work with it. very usuful tool.

**Images**
In the images, I optimize it https://tinypng.com/, before I attached it to my project. It was fun and quite difficult to work with grid but getting there. I guess, I was able to used the grid propeties
right in my project. Hopefully. I used display: grid in photo-grid section. use grdi templates of arrange it. 


The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Good luck and have fun!
